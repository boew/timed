replace-match is a built-in function in `C source code'.

(replace-match NEWTEXT &optional FIXEDCASE LITERAL STRING SUBEXP)

Replace text matched by last search with NEWTEXT.
Leave point at the end of the replacement text.

If optional second arg FIXEDCASE is non-nil, do not alter the case of
the replacement text.  Otherwise, maybe capitalize the whole text, or
maybe just word initials, based on the replaced text.  If the replaced
text has only capital letters and has at least one multiletter word,
convert NEWTEXT to all caps.  Otherwise if all words are capitalized
in the replaced text, capitalize each word in NEWTEXT.

If optional third arg LITERAL is non-nil, insert NEWTEXT literally.
Otherwise treat `\' as special:
  `\&' in NEWTEXT means substitute original matched text.
  `\N' means substitute what matched the Nth `\(...\)'.
       If Nth parens didn't match, substitute nothing.
  `\\' means insert one `\'.
  `\?' is treated literally
       (for compatibility with `query-replace-regexp').
  Any other character following `\' signals an error.
Case conversion does not apply to these substitutions.

If optional fourth argument STRING is non-nil, it should be a string
to act on; this should be the string on which the previous match was
done via `string-match'.  In this case, `replace-match' creates and
returns a new string, made by copying STRING and replacing the part of
STRING that was matched (the original STRING itself is not altered).

The optional fifth argument SUBEXP specifies a subexpression;
it says to replace just that subexpression with NEWTEXT,
rather than replacing the entire matched text.
This is, in a vague sense, the inverse of using `\N' in NEWTEXT;
`\N' copies subexp N into NEWTEXT, but using N as SUBEXP puts
NEWTEXT in place of subexp N.
This is useful only after a regular expression search or match,
since only regular expressions have distinguished subexpressions.

=======
search-forward-regexp is an interactive built-in function in
`subr.el'.

(search-forward-regexp REGEXP &optional BOUND NOERROR COUNT)

Search forward from point for regular expression REGEXP.
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend after that position.
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.

Search case-sensitivity is determined by the value of the variable
`case-fold-search', which see.

See also the functions `match-beginning', `match-end', `match-string',
and `replace-match'.

=====

search-forward is an interactive built-in function in `C source code'.

It is bound to <find>.

(search-forward STRING &optional BOUND NOERROR COUNT)

Search forward from point for STRING.
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend after that position.  A value of nil is
  equivalent to (point-max).
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument COUNT, if non-nil, means to search for COUNT
 successive occurrences.  If COUNT is negative, search backward,
 instead of forward, for -COUNT occurrences.

Search case-sensitivity is determined by the value of the variable
`case-fold-search', which see.

See also the functions `match-beginning', `match-end' and `replace-match'.
